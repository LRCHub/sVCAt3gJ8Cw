[00:35.22] I've been driving, a mid-sized car
[00:40.74] Never hurt anyone
[00:46.16] Is that a fact?
[00:46.95] Is that a fact?
[00:48.45] Is that a fact?
[00:49.91] Is that a fact?
[00:57.41] 
[00:51.46] The price of gas keeps on rising
[00:56.90] Nothing comes for free
[01:02.59] Make like a stone, make like a plant
[01:05.57] Make like a stone, make like a plant
[01:09.79] I can tell you, how this ends
[01:24.29] 
[01:13.87] We're gonna win this
[01:24.02] We're gonna win this
[01:29.62] We're gonna win this
[01:39.62] 
[01:35.38] With spades and truncheons, guns and trowels
[01:43.56] That is how the war will be won
[01:48.14] Just swat the fly
[01:49.26] Just swat the fly
[01:50.52] Just swat the fly
[01:51.87] Just swat the fly
[02:00.37] 
[01:54.88] Taking care of cars and bodies
[02:02.47] Nothing ever comes for free
[02:04.85] The ghosts are here
[02:06.14] The ghosts are here
[02:07.35] Red white and blue
[02:08.80] Red white and blue
[02:17.80]

[02:17.45] We're going win this
[02:25.10] We're gonna win this
[02:31.23] We're gonna win this
[02:36.89] We're gonna win
[02:44.39] 
[02:43.62] We're going win this
[03:22.46] We're going win this
